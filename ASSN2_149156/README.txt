Hello, I'm Thanish A/L Natarajan. I had created a program called anagram that generates anagram of words.
Longer character words takes longer time to process. This program uses queue, stack and link list data structure.
The program is designed only for word with distinct alphabets only. The program also can search for a specific word
and do displaying, updating, deleting, adding a new word after the searched word and also display anagrams starts 
with specific alphabet of searched word.
